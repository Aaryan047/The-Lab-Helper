# The Lab Helper

The Lab Helper is a practical, topic-wise collection of **C++ implementations** for commonly taught algorithms, data structures, and classical programming problems.

This repository is designed as a **lab and reference utility** — not a tutorial series, not a competitive programming template dump, and not a shortcut for interviews.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is simple:

- provide **correct, compilable C++ code**
- organize algorithms **by topic** for quick access
- serve as a **reliable reference** during labs, practice, and revision

The focus is on **clarity, consistency, and correctness**, not clever tricks or micro-optimizations.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic.  
Each top-level folder contains self-contained implementations related to that area.

Each file is written to be:
- easy to locate
- easy to compile
- safe to use in labs and coursework

## What This Repository Is (and Isn’t)

### It **is**:
- a lab helper
- a quick reference for standard algorithms
- a clean collection of fundamental implementations

### It **is not**:
- a competitive programming cheat sheet
- an interview preparation guide
- a replacement for textbooks or theory notes

Advanced optimizations and CP-specific tricks are **intentionally avoided**.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome, provided they:
- follow the existing folder structure
- maintain readability and consistency
- avoid unnecessary optimizations
- include only standard, well-known approaches

If you find bugs, unclear logic, or missing edge cases, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
